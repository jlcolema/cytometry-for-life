      <td class="content" valign="top" width="72%"><h1>History of CD4</h1>
        <p>In
the 40 years since the invention of the cell sorter by Mack Fulwyler, a
revolution has occured within the world of immunology primarily driven
by innovations of Len Herzenberg and others as cytometry matured into a
powerful technology in medical research and clinical practice.</p>
        <p>Today
however, there are between 30 and 40 million individuals in
resource-poor nations infected with the HIV virus who desperately need
to receive antiviral therapy. There are two primary reasons why they
don't get it. First, the cost is high. Many individuals are working
hard to reduce the cost of this therapy. Second, in order to receive
therapy, each individual must be monitored for his/her CD4 levels. This
is primarily done by flow cytometry. Unfortunately flow cytometry is
complex and expensive in today's technology-focused world.</p>
        <p>It
should not be. Cytometers can be made very inexpensively. The
technology is 40 years old. It has matured to a point that while next
generation ideas are important, they are not the solution for the
immediate problem of AIDS patient evaluation for CD4 levels in Africa
today.</p>
        <h1>Blood cells - lymphocytes, monocytes, and granulocyes</h1>
        <p>Essentially
there are 3 subsets of cells in blood - white bloods cells (WBCs), red
blood cells (RBCs) and platelets. Blood is red primarily because we
have 1000 RBCs for every single WBC. So its hard to even find a white
blood cell. Its gets worse when you want to count CD4 cells. White
blood cells can be broadly divided into three further classifications -
lymphocytes, monocytes, and granulocytes. CD4 cells are in the
lymphocyte family. Within lymphocytes we have cells commonly called B
cells (they make immunoglobulin to give you immunity) and T cells (they
recognize and fight many diseases), and an assortment of rather odd and
complex cells. We know the approximate number of cells that appear in
"normal" individuals, so we see that about 70% of lymphocytes appear to
be T cells (called CD3 cells) and about 15-20% appear to be B cells
(called CD20 cells). Within the T cells we have many recognized subsets
of cells - but most people recognize those called CD4 (about 45% of T
cells) and CD8 (about 25% of T cells). In a normal person that means
that there are about two CD4 cells for every single CD8 cells.
Actually, when you look at lymphocytes under a microscope as in the
photos just below, its impossible to tell the difference between any of
the lymphocytes subsets - the T cells, B cells or the non-T non-B
lymphocytes. You have to use special tags as described in the section <a href="http://www.cytometryforlife.org/cd4_testing.html">CD4 Testing Today.</a></p>

        <br>
        <h1>What is CD4 and why do we need to measure it?</h1>
        <p>CD4
is the name we use to identify a special subset of lymphocytes that is
vital for fighting disease (see the blue cell in the image at left -
the pink colored cells are red blood cells). A lymphocyte is one of the
several types of white blood cells that are in our blood. The
lymphocyes are know as "immune cells" and they do exactly what that
sounds like - they are very important cells in our immune response to
infections. It turns out that the AIDS virus attaches itself to the CD4
cell and destroys it. The HIV virus actually uses the CD4 cells as its
replication base and in replicating, it destroys the cell. Eventually
an HIV positive person will lose CD4 cells to the point that they
cannot survive. The more these individuals get infections with
different organisms, the more likely that person will lose immune
protection against those organisms. At some point, it is almost
impossible for someone to fight off infections that would normally do
very little to healthy people. So knowing how many CD4 lymphocytes a
patient has is a crucial piece of information that a physician needs
when deciding whether or not a patient should receive antiviral
therapy. In fact, in many places, it is necessary to identify the
number of CD4 cells in a person's blood prior to making a decision to
give therapy.</p>
        <h1>How is CD4 measured?</h1>
        <p>We
measure blood cells by relating how many there are in a cubic
millimeter of blood. There are published "normal" ranges for blood
cells. Strangely, they seem to differ depending what country you come
from - and the numbers also vary according to age. When we measure the
absolute number of CD4 cells in a normal person we should expect to
have a range of about 500-1500. Since we frequently have about twice
the number of CD4 cells as CD8 cells, we would then expect the CD8
absolute numbers to be in the range of 250-750 - but in fact they vary
quite a lot owing to infections, time of day, the total WBC count, and
lots of other factors. This makes it a little difficult to talk about
exact numbers. </p>
        <h1>CD4 and AIDS </h1>
        <p>You hear
a lot about about CD4 in the context of AIDS because as stated earlier,
the HIV virus destroys CD4 cells. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC)
has defined some diagnostic values: one is that a person with a CD4
count less than 200 is considered to have AIDS. (There is also a
requirement for a low percentage of CD4 cells as well). One of the
problems that occurs in measuring total CD4 cells is that you can't
just measure the total number of CD4+ cells. Why not? Well because it
turns out that some monocytes also express positive CD4. So, if you are
not careful, you will get a false number of CD4 cells. </p>
        <p>How
do you fix that? The easiest way is to make sure that the cells you are
measuring are T cells (monocytes are not T cells). So if you also
measure total T cells (CD3) and make sure you know what percentage of
CD3+ cells are also CD4+ you have an accurate number. There are
actually several other ways that you can measure CD4 cells but they are
not discussed here. </p>
        <p>The current preferred test for CD4 cell counts is using flow cytometry. You can find out more about flow cytometry by going to <a href="http://www.cytometryforlife.org/cd4_testing.html">CD4 Testing Today</a>.</p></td>
