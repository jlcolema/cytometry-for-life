        <h1>Scientists Bring Solutions to AIDS testing in Africa </h1>
        <p class="content">Scientists
at Purdue University have developed a program to effectively attack a
very difficult problem for AIDS patients particularly on the continent
of Africa. There are many problems, but one problem that has been
plaguing health care providers across Africa is the inability to
monitor blood lymphocyte levels in patients. This simple test is
current run on very expensive, very complex instruments that are
difficult to maintain even in very advanced laboratories. They have
little chance of working efficiently in rural Africa where the greater
majority of AIDS patients are. The Cytometry for Life program will
bring a battery operated, very low cost, highly reliable lymphocyte
counter to any location needed. It's a simple, elegent, low cost
solution. It's a solution that Africa cannot afford to have. </p>
        <h1>What is the "Cytometry for Life" program? </h1>
        <p>Cytometry
is a field of science that has been around for about 50 years. It is
the study of cells and their environment. The living cell is the
smallest independent operational unit of the body and understanding how
cells work is what cytometry is all about.</p>
        
        <p>When
cells fail to work, there are serious conssequences - like cancer for
instance where some abnormal cells take over the body with disasterous
consequences. In AIDS, a virus takes over a very important cell, the
CD4 lymphocyte. It destroys the cell and eventually the patient cannot
survive.</p>
        
        <p>Cytometry really started about 50
years ago with the invention of simple cell analysis tools like the
Coulter Counter - a machine that counts blood cells. This was followed
by an instrument to sort blood cells into different populations and
this instrument was called a cell sorter - a type of flow cytometer. In
the 40 years since the invention of the cell sorter by Mack Fulwyler, a
revolution has occurred within the world of immunology, primarily
driven by innovations of Len Herzenberg and others as cytometry matured
into a powerful technology in medical research and clinical practice.</p>
        
        <p>Today
however, there are between 30 and 40 million individuals in
resource-poor nations infected with the HIV virus who desperately need
to receive antiviral therapy. There are two primary reasons why they
don't get it. First, the cost is high. Many individuals are working
hard to reduce the cost of this therapy. Second, in order to receive
therapy, each individual must be monitored for his/her CD4 levels. This
is primarily done by flow cytometry. Unfortunately flow cytometry is
complex and expensive in today's technology-focused world.</p>
         <p>It
should not be. Cytometers can be made very inexpensively. The
technology is 40 years old. It has matured to a point that, while next
generation ideas are important, they are not the best solution for the
immediate problem of AIDS patient evaluation for CD4 levels in Africa
today.</p>
        <br>
        <h1>The <em>Cytometry for Life</em> program aims to achieve the following goals in two primary stages</h1>
        <p class="style1">Stage 1: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Reduce the cost of CD4 measuring instruments to $5000 or less</li>
          <li>Reduce the cost of a single test for CD4 to 50 cents or less</li>
          <li>Build instruments that do not require large power or computer sources</li>
          <li>Build instruments that are robust, very easy to use, and yet very high quality</li>
          <li>Protect all  technology and reagents under the management of the <strong><em>Cytometry for Life</em></strong> program</li>
        </ul>        
        <p class="style8">Stage 2: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Develop a manufacturing model for widespread distribution and management</li>
          <li>Develop a reagent program that supports the instrumentation and functions in remote areas </li>
          <li>Link with Agencies to faciliate distribution to places of need and provide long term maintenance programs </li>
        </ul> <br>       
        <h1>Current Partnerships</h1>
        <p>The <strong><em>Cytometry for Life</em></strong> program was initiated by individuals in the cytometry community who want to make a difference <strong>today</strong>-
both academics and business people. The goal is to create a program
that has as its primary goal, saving lives by using current-day
technology at the most effective level and at the lowest possible cost.
</p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p>The consortium has already been
successful in raising over $250,000 in funds. We have set two funding
goals for the program. First to raise $1 million to get the technology
and the reagents designed and robust. Our second goal will be to raise
another $4 million to deliver the technology across the nations of need
to save those lives from the pain and agony of AIDS to give these
individuals at least a chance of raising their children, educating them
and giving them an opportunity to impact their families well-being.
This project will change the lives of millions of people, not only in
Africa where we will initiate the program, but in many other resource
poor nations. </p>
         
        </blockquote><br>
        <h1>You can help </h1>
        <p>The "<span class="style7">Cytometry for Life</span>" program needs your help to achieve our goals of very cheap tests for AIDS victims in Africa. </p>

        <p align="justify">We
are trying to get quality input into our CD4 project. In order to do
this we have created a detailed survey that contains many questions
about the CD4 assay and the conditions under which it is needed and
carried out. Regardless of who you are or where you are from, we would
like your opinion. In order to properly analyze the data however, we
will need to know something about you - your experience level, your
knowledge of the field, where you are located, etc. You can answer the
general questions without identifying yourself, but we would like to
have your complete contact information if possible so that we can
continue to work with you on this project. </p>
