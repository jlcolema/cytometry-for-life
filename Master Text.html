<h1>Cytometry for Life</h1>

Changing Lives Through Low-Cost Diagnostics 

<h1>What is the Cytometry for Life Program?</h1>

	<p>Across Sub-Saharan Africa millions of AIDS (Acquired Immune Deﬁciency Syndrome) victims are desperately in need of antiretroviral treatment. The measurement of the CD4 T-lymphocyte cell levels in the blood of AIDS patients is a critical step that enables AIDS patients to become eligible for therapy. Major gaps exist in the availability of affordable CD4 testing capabilities for the majority of HIV-positive Africans. The Cytometry for Life (C4L) program aims to mitigate this problem by providing low-cost CD4 T-cell testing devices for HIV/AIDS patients in areas plagued by the AIDS epidemic that do not have sufﬁcient access to affordable CD4 testing capabilities. Current costs for CD4 testing range from 10 to 12 USD; we propose to decrease this cost to 0.25 to 0.50 USD per test by using innovatively engineered and robust cytometry devices designed to measure only CD4 levels in terms of absolute count and percentage. Such an initiative is critical since approximately 30 million people are infected in Sub-Saharan Africa and almost 320 million Africans exist in extreme poverty, living on less than $1 a day [1]. Therefore, it is critical that the future of cytometry devices for CD4 measurement in Africa incorporate low-cost options.</p>

	<h2>Why Cytometry for Life?</h2>

		<p>The motivation for Purdue's Cytometry for Life (C4L) program grew out of a call to action by Mr. Stephen Lewis, the UN Secretary General's Special Envoy to HIV/AIDS Relief in Africa, when Mr. Lewis spoke at the 23rd Congress of the International Society for Analytical Cytology (ISAC) in Canada in May, 2006. Mr. Lewis indicated that one major problem (among many) in caring for infected patients in Africa was the lack of low-cost CD4 cell testing technologies.</p>

		<p>Flow cytometers designed for highly industrialized health care environments are the same machines currently being used in developing countries. These instruments are multifaceted and were designed to perform 50 to 100 different tests. In addition to CD4 analysis, such cytometers have the capacity to perform complex multivariate analysis, link to advanced communication systems, and are often fully automated. However, in order to respond to the AIDS crisis across Africa, Cytometry for Life is introducing a new breed of cytometer that only measures CD4 T-lymphocyte levels. In the C4L approach, the cytometer device functionality is targeted to one overarching objective: AIDS epidemic mitigation via CD4 monitoring to facilitate antiretroviral treatment procedures. This targeted single-function approach is the primary means by which Cytometry for Life is able to offer such medical innovation with a signiﬁcantly reduced cost while maintaining the highest standards of quality in terms of the CD4 testing procedure and result generation.</p>

		<p>As HIV/AIDS ravages nations in Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Caribbean, it is critical that scientists or supporters of international health and development initiatives contribute to the provision of innovative testing capabilities. Such initiatives must respond speciﬁcally to the need for accurate, low-cost CD4 measurement tools that can operate optimally in remote locations, in a timely fashion.</p>

	<h2>The Cytometry for Life CD4 Counting Device</h2>

		<p>The instrument for the Cytometry for Life program is designed solely to measure CD4 levels in absolute count and percentage of T-cells. Cytometer instrument costs and individual test costs are minimized because the machine does not include complex automated ﬂuidics or optics systems. For example, Cytometry for Life has designed an integrated module for the optical and ﬂuidic assembly. The electronics are composed of minimal but very powerful chips. There is no separate computer attached or needed with this technology and therefore it does not require software integration. A USB port has been added to extract data should there be a need to do so. The instrument is low maintenance and does not require highly skilled technicians to operate. The Cytometry for Life CD4 counting instrument is portable and is housed in a small, solid carrying case that includes all necessary reagents and the battery power source. The Cytometry for Life low-cost CD4 testing device is designed to have the capacity to operate in remote, intemperate, and humid regions and not rely on a constant source of electricity.</p>

		<p>Cytometry for Life is collaborating with the Regenstrief Center for Health Care Engineering (RCHCE) and the Center for Advanced Manufacturing (CAM) at Purdue University to ensure that the Cytometry for Life low-cost CD4 testing device design can be manufactured in large quantities, at an economical price.</p>

	<!-- INSET -->

		<p>Significance of CD4 cell counts in HIV/AIDS -- CD4-positive T-helper cells are a sub-group of lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell or leukocyte). A CD4 count is used to monitor immune-system function in HIV-positive individuals. A declining CD4 T-cell count is associated with progression of HIV infection. In HIV-positive patients, AIDS is officially diagnosed when the count drops below 200 cells/µL. Low CD4 counts in HIV-positive individuals (< 200 cells/µL) is a strong indicator that antiretroviral therapy should be administered.</p>

		<p>Antiretroviral Therapy (ART) refers to the treatment of retroviruses, primarily HIV, through usage of certain therapeutic antiretroviral drugs that act at different stages of the virus life cycle.</p>

		<p>Lewis spoke of CD4 machines -- which measure the number of CD4 immune cells and indicate whether someone with AIDS should be treated -- that are bulky, difficult to use and, at about $50,000 each, vastly out of reach for most of the continent.

		<p>Lewis continues to speak against what he sees as "unconscionable neglect" and "reckless indifference" to AIDS. "I think the global community has responded lamentably," he says, his voice rising. "We're fighting for human lives, what in God's name is wrong with these people?" Apoorva Mandavilli, Nature Medicine, volume 12: number 10, page 1107 October 2006.</p>

	<h2>The Importance of Cytometry for HIV/AIDS in Africa</h2>

		<p>In Sub-Saharan Africa, there is a great need for antiretroviral therapy. Deﬁciencies in CD4 testing capacity remain a major barrier for the administration of antiretroviral therapy. The guidelines for antiretroviral therapy (ART) from the World Health Organization mandate therapeutic intervention for patients with Stage I or II HIV disease with CD4 cell counts less than 200/µl in Sub-Saharan Africa. This CD4 T-lymphocyte assessment is done by ﬂow cytometry. Unfortunately, ﬂow cytometry is a complex and expensive method in today's high technology-focused world.</p>

		<p>This problem can be solved. Cytometers can be made very inexpensively. With a 40-year history of technological development, cytometry has matured to a point that it can now be simpliﬁed for speciﬁc purposes, such as measurement of CD4 cells. While next-generation ideas are very important and have increased commercial opportunity for westernized healthcare networks, they are not the best solution for the immediate problem of evaluating AIDS patients in Africa today. The complexity of cytometers currently in use drives up the cost for the consumer, limits the number of instruments that can be purchased, and also increases the need for high-cost maintenance and highly skilled operators. Introduction of low-cost, robust, and portable machines through the Cytometry for Life program seeks to close gaps in CD4 testing coverage, particularly in rural African settings which demand innovative solutions in order to best service this target population.</p>

	<!-- INSET -->

		<p>Every day in Africa... HIV/AIDS kills about 6,600 people of whom approximately 1,400 are children</p>
		<p>Almost 9,000 more are infected with the HIV virus (http://www.data.org/whyafrica/checkthefacts/)</p>
		<p>"Sub-Saharan Africa has just over 10% of the world's population, but is home to more than 60% of all people infected with HIV/AIDS. In 2005, an estimated 3.2 million people in the region became newly infected, while 2.4 million adults and children died of AIDS." (http://www.unaids.org)</p>

<h1>Rural vs Urban: What are the challenges of implenting CD4 testing capabilities in rural Africa?</h1>

	<p>UNAIDS estimates that over half the approximately 30 million people living with HIV/AIDS in Sub-Saharan Africa reside in rural areas. Poverty in Africa is particularly onerous in rural areas. More than 70% of the continent's poor people live in rural challenges of implementing CD4 areas. The Cytometry for Life program responds to a testing capabilities in rural Africa? fundamental and urgent need for the introduction of low-cost, robust, and portable CD4 testing devices. UNAIDS estimates that over half the approximately This is especially critical in rural areas where CD4 30 million people living with HIV/AIDS in Sub-testing capacity must still contend with exorbitant Saharan Africa reside in rural areas. Poverty in Africa costs, inaccessibility, and a lack of trained personnel to operate and maintain equipment. While some current cytometry instruments are suitable for urban areas with sufficient infrastructure, rural/remote areas with moderate to poor infrastructure are still urgently in need of affordable, environment-appropriate CD4 testing solutions.</p>

	<h2>History of Cytometry</h2>

		<p>Cytometry is about the measurement of cells and their various environments. In AIDS, a virus takes over a very important cell, the CD4 lymphocyte. The cell is destroyed, the immune system is compromised and eventually, the patient cannot survive. Cytometry is the ﬁeld of science that began approximately 50 years ago with Wallace Coulter's cell counter invention, which is basically an instrument that counts cells or particles. Expansion of the original Coulter blood cell counter resulted in an instrument called the Cell Sorter that could count blood cells as well as sort them according to their physical and chemical characteristics. The Cell Sorter was invented by Mack Fulwyler in 1965. In the 40 years since the invention of the Cell Sorter, a revolution has occurred within the world of immunology, driven primarily by the innovations of Leonard Herzenberg, an immunologist and recipient of the 2006 internationally renowned Kyoto Prize for his signiﬁcant contributions to cytometry. Herzenberg's work catalyzed the maturation of cytometry as a powerful technology in medical research and clinical practice. Present-day expansions of Fulwyler's work, known as Flow Cytometry, are techniques for counting, analyzing, and sorting microscopic particles or cells that have been suspended in reagent or streams of ﬂuid. This technology allows concurrent multiparametric analysis of chemical and/or physical characteristics of single cells ﬂowing through an optical and/or electronic detection apparatus.</p>

		<p>This technology is now used in all kinds of clinical applications that involve hematological abnormalities such as leukemias and lymphomas, as well as monitoring the status of patients with AIDS.</p>

		<h3>How does the ﬂow cytometer work?</h3>

			<p>A laser beam (the blue line) passes through a ﬂow chamber where a stream of ﬂuid is ﬂowing. Within the stream, the cells are ﬂowing single ﬁle. These cells have different ﬂuorescent labels on them. When a cell with an attached ﬂuorescent molecule passes through the laser beam, photons are emitted. These photons are measured on detectors (see the different colors going out the back of the chamber). Using light scatter signals, it is also possible to determine morphological characteristics (shape, size, etc.) of each cell.</p>

		<!-- INSET -->

			<p>This is the key part of a flow cytometer -- you can see cells in the middle stream of fluid -- the blue line shows the laser excitation; where it strikes the cells, a signal is sent out to several detectors that allows us to determine the identity of the cells based on their physical characteristics.</p>
 
<h1>The Science of CD4 Testing</h1>

	<p>CD4 testing is a normal practice in the clinical laboratory, and is accomplished through the use of ﬂow cytometry. Flow cytometry is a standard technique used in virtually every hospital and research institution around the world. While ﬂow cytometry techniques are straightforward, they are not necessarily simple, particularly when applied to clinical practice. A great deal of automated technology is employed to gather measurements, analyze data, and produce reports. Consequently, the cost of performing these tests is relatively high.</p>

	<h2>How is a CD4 test performed today?</h2>

		<p>CD4 testing is performed by a ﬂow cytometer. In this process, a small tube of blood cells is treated with a reagent which is speciﬁc to the CD4 lymphocyte (a type of white blood cell).</p>

		<p>The reagents used for identiﬁcation are called monoclonal antibodies (MABs). These antibodies can speciﬁcally attach to a certain type of cell. In this case, the antibody will attach to a CD4 T-cell. Certain molecules (called ﬂuorochromes) are attached to the antibody (such as the green dots below) to aid in the identiﬁcation process.</p>

		<p>When a laser beam is ﬁred at the cells, those cells with the attached molecules emit a signal identifying themselves. This signal is called ﬂuorescence and can easily be measured with sensitive detectors. The colors of ﬂuorescence can also be changed by adding "red" colors to some antibodies and "green" colors to other antibodies. This allows us to make two measurements at the same time. If hundreds or thousands of cells are forced past the laser very quickly, an accurate count can be obtained of all cells that are present.</p>

		<p>CD4 cells are measured in this manner. CD is an acronym for "cluster of differentiation," and that simply means that this molecule can be classiﬁed into a well deﬁned group of cells. In this case, it is cluster of differentiation 4, or a CD4 helper T-lymphocyte cell.</p>

	<h2>How are the results interpreted?</h2>

		<p>First, the data are collected in the ﬂow cytometer. Each cell is plotted in a histogram display, which is a frequency distribution. In a typical histogram as shown to the right, two peaks appear.</p>

		<p>The ﬁrst peak represents cells that are negative, and thus have no speciﬁc binding to the probe. The second peak represents cells that are "positive" for that particular marker, or monoclonal antibody (MAB). Thus, if this were a CD4 MAB, these cells would be considered CD4+ positive (cluster of differentiation positive). From this histogram we can determine the percentage of cells positive for this MAB.</p>

		<p>Using additional monoclonal antibodies it is possible to classify each type of cell (or subset of cells) present in the blood. In the ﬁeld of cytometry, this is called multiple labeling or multi-color ﬂuorescence, as shown below.</p>

	<!-- INSET -->

		<p>Example of how a monoclonal antibody (MAB) binds to specific receptors on lymphocytes -- these antibodies can have colored tags that emit light in specific colors when the tag is excited.</p>

		<p>A multipanel display of monoclonal antibodies (MABs) binding to cells. Each histogram identifies a different cluster of cells in the sample. If we integrate the histogram we can determine exactly how many cells are present in each histogram.</p>

	<h2>Where do the reagents come from?</h2>

		<p>The reagents used to identify CD4 cells and other cells types are called monoclonal antibodies (MABs). These MABs are conjugated (labeled) with fluorescent molecules that can easily be identified using a ﬂow cytometer. These MABs require precise and careful manufacturing protocols. They are quite expensive. In many cases, in addition to the cost of the instrument, the cost of reagents contributes greatly to the overall expense of CD4 determination.</p>

	<!-- INSET -->

		<h3>CD4 Lymphocytes</h3>
		<h3>CD8 Lymphocytes</h3>

		<p>Normal human lymphocytes, T-cells are indistinguishable from other lymphocytes using normal visual or size evaluation. To tell the difference, we must add a monoclonal antibody that binds to a specific receptor on either the CD4 or the CD8 cells. We also add a fluorescent molecule to the antibodies and then use flow cytometry to measure the percentage of each type of lymphocyte present.</p>
