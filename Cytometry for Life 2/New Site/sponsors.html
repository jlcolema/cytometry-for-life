			<p>The <em>Cytometry for Life</em> program is an extension of the <a href="#">Purdue University Cytometry Laboratories</a> within the Bindley Bioscience Center at Purdue University&rsquo;s Discovery Park. The program is entirely driven to change the lives of people in areas most impacted by HIV/AIDS, particularly on the African continent.</p>

			<h2>Current Partnerships</h2>

			<p>The <em>Cytometry for Life</em> program was initiated by academic and industry experts in the ﬁeld of cytometry who want to make a difference today. Their drive is to create a program that is focused on changing lives through the usage of current-day technology at the most effective level and at the lowest possible cost.</p>

			<p>The <em>Cytometry for Life</em> consortium has already successfully generated over $250,000 in funds. Two funding goals for the program have been set: (1) to raise $1 million to design robust technology and reagents; and (2) to raise another $4 million to deliver the technology across nations in need. This project is entirely driven to mitigate the AIDS epidemic in Africa and respond to the need for low-cost and sustainable CD4 testing capabilities that function efﬁciently within rural African environments with minimal healthcare infrastructure. <em>Cytometry for Life</em> has the potential to positively impact the lives of millions of people in Africa and other nations severely affected by HIV/AIDS.</p>

					<h3>Survey on CD4</h3>
					<p>We are trying to get quality input into our CD4 project. In order to do this we have created a detailed survey that contains many questions about the CD4 assay and the conditions under which it is needed and carried out. Regardless of who you are or where you are from, we would like your opinion. In order to properly analyze the data however, we will need to know something about you &ndash; your experience level, your knowledge of the field, where you are located, etc. You can answer general questions without identifying yourself, but we would like to have your complete contact information if possible so that we can continue to work with you on this project.</p>

					<p><a href="#">The survey can be found on the sponsor page of this website.</a></p>
