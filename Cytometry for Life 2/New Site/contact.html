			<p>J. Paul Robinson is the SVM Professor of Cytomics in the School of Veterinary Medicine and a professor in the Weldon School of Biomedical Engineering at Purdue University. He received his Ph.D. in Immunopathology from the University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia. He is the director of the Purdue University Cytometry Laboratories and Deputy Director for Cytomics and Imaging in the Bindley Bioscience Center.</p>

			<p>He is the President of the International Society for Analytical Cytology and the Editor-in-Chief of Current Protocols in Cytometry. He is an active researcher with over 110 peer reviewed publications and 20 book chapters, has edited 7 books, and has given over 80 international lectures. He was elected to the College of Fellows of the American Institute for Medical and Biological Engineering in 2004, was the winner of the Pﬁzer Award for Innovative Research in 2004, and the Gamma Sigma Delta Award of Merit Research in 2002.</p>

			<p>His research area has focused on reactive oxygen species, primarily in neutrophils, but more recently in HL-60 cells and other cell lines. His lab is currently studying the biochemical pathways of apoptosis as related to reactive oxygen species in mitochondria. His group has a strong interest in bioengineering, with hardware and software groups developing innovative technologies such as high-speed multispectral cytometry, optical tools for quantitative ﬂuorescence measurement, and advanced classiﬁcation approaches for clinical diagnostics.</p>

			<p>Gary Durack is the founder, President and Chief Technical Ofﬁcer of iCyt Visionary Bioscience. He also currently holds an appointment with the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign as the Associate Director for Technology in the university&rsquo;s Biotechnology Center. He is the author of numerous publications, has edited a book on advanced technologies, and is recognized internationally as an expert in the ﬁeld of cytometry. He currently serves as a Technical Councilor for the International Society for Analytical Cytology. He received a BS in electrical engineering from Purdue University.</p>

			<p>From 1979 through 1989 he worked for Coulter Electronics Inc. (now Beckman Coulter Inc.). During his tenure at the company, Mr. Durack served as a ﬁeld applications specialist, director of their customer support operations, and manager of the research cytometry instrument development program.</p>

			<p>In 1989 he moved to Purdue University to manage the Purdue University Cytometry Laboratories. In 1993 he was appointed Director of the University of Illinois Biotechnology Center Cytometry Facility. In his seven years as director he secured substantial grant and research contract support to modernize instrumentation and to develop new technologies at the UIUC Cytometry Facility. Among these developments was the ﬁrst DSP-based ﬂow cytometer capable of performing ﬂuorescent lifetime measurement. During this period he collaborated with numerous UIUC faculty, taught a graduate course in ﬂow cytometry, authored several papers, edited a book, and wrote several book chapters.</p>

			<p>Since 2000 he has been engaged in numerous cytometry-related design and development projects for Fortune 500 companies, as well as products now marketed through iCyt Mission Technology. These products include the X-Cyt&trade; Software for cytometry information management, the Lyt 200&trade; solid state laser, and the Reﬂection&reg; multi-channel, high-speed cell-sorting system.</p>

					<h3>Survey on CD4</h3>
					<p>We are trying to get quality input into our CD4 project. In order to do this we have created a detailed survey that contains many questions about the CD4 assay and the conditions under which it is needed and carried out. Regardless of who you are or where you are from, we would like your opinion. In order to properly analyze the data however, we will need to know something about you &ndash; your experience level, your knowledge of the field, where you are located, etc. You can answer general questions without identifying yourself, but we would like to have your complete contact information if possible so that we can continue to work with you on this project.</p>

					<p><a href="#">The survey can be found on the sponsor page of this website.</a></p>
