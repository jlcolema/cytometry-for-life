			<h1>History of Cytometry</h1>

			<p>Cytometry is about the measurement of cells and their various environments. In AIDS, a virus takes over a very important cell, the CD4 lymphocyte. The cell is destroyed, the immune system is compromised and eventually, the patient cannot survive. Cytometry is the ﬁeld of science that began approximately 50 years ago with Wallace Coulter&rsquo;s cell counter invention, which is basically an instrument that counts cells or particles. Expansion of the original Coulter blood cell counter resulted in an instrument called the Cell Sorter that could count blood cells as well as sort them according to their physical and chemical characteristics. The Cell Sorter was invented by Mack Fulwyler in 1965. In the 40 years since the invention of the Cell Sorter, a revolution has occurred within the world of immunology, driven primarily by the innovations of Leonard Herzenberg, an immunologist and recipient of the 2006 internationally renowned Kyoto Prize for his signiﬁ cant contributions to cytometry. Herzenberg&rsquo;s work catalyzed the maturation of cytometry as a powerful technology in medical research and clinical practice. Present-day expansions of Fulwyler&rsquo;s work, known as Flow Cytometry, are techniques for counting, analyzing, and sorting microscopic particles or cells that have been suspended in reagent or streams of ﬂuid. This technology allows concurrent multiparametric analysis of chemical and/or physical characteristics of single cells ﬂowing through an optical and/or electronic detection apparatus.</p>

			<p>This technology is now used in all kinds of clinical applications that involve hematological abnormalities such as leukemias and lymphomas, as well as monitoring the status of patients with AIDS.</p>

			<p>How does the ﬂow cytometer work?</p>

			<p>A laser beam (the blue line) passes through a ﬂow chamber where a stream of ﬂuid is ﬂowing. Within the stream, the cells are ﬂowing single ﬁle. These cells have different ﬂuorescent labels on them.When a cell with an attached ﬂuorescent molecule passes through the laser beam, photons are emitted.These photons are measured on detectors (see the different colors going out the back of the chamber). Using light scatter signals, it is also possible to determine morphological characteristics (shape, size, etc.) of each cell.</p>

			<p>This is the key part of a flow cytometer &ndash; you can see cells in the middle stream of fluid &ndash; the blue line shows the laser excitation; where it strikes the cells, a signal is sent out to several detectors that allows us to determine the identity of the cells based on their physical characteristics.</p>
 
			<h2>The Science of CD4 Testing</h2>

			<p>CD4 testing is a normal practice in the clinical laboratory, and is accomplished through the use of ﬂow cytometry. Flow cytometry is a standard technique used in virtually every hospital and research institution around the world. While ﬂow cytometry techniques are straightforward, they are not necessarily simple, particularly when applied to clinical practice. A great deal of automated technology is employed to gather measurements, analyze data, and produce reports. Consequently, the cost of performing these tests is relatively high.</p>

			<p>How is a CD4 test performed today?</p>

			<p>CD4 testing is performed by a ﬂow cytometer. In this process, a small tube of blood cells is treated with a reagent which is speciﬁc to the CD4 lymphocyte (a type of white blood cell).</p>

			<p>The reagents used for identiﬁcation are called monoclonal antibodies (MABs). These antibodies can speciﬁcally attach to a certain type of cell. In this case, the antibody will attach to a CD4 T cell. Certain molecules (called ﬂuorochromes) are attached to the antibody (such as the green dots below) to aid in the identiﬁcation process.</p>

			<p>Example of how a monoclonal antibody (MAB) binds to specific receptors on lymphocytes &ndash; these antibodies can have colored tags that emit light in specific colors when the tag is excited.</p>

			<p>When a laser beam is ﬁred at the cells, those cells with the attached molecules emit a signal identifying themselves. This signal is called ﬂ uorescence and can easily be measured with sensitive detectors. The colors of ﬂuorescence can also be changed by adding &ldquo;red&rdquo; colors to some antibodies and &ldquo;green&rdquo; colors to other antibodies. This allows us to make two measurements at the same time. If hundreds or thousands of cells are forced past the laser very quickly, an accurate count can be obtained of all cells that are present.</p>

			<p>CD4 cells are measured in this manner. CD is an acronym for &ldquo;cluster of differentiation,&rdquo; and that simply means that this molecule can be classiﬁ ed into a well deﬁned group of cells. In this case, it is cluster of differentiation 4, or a CD4 helper T lymphocyte cell.</p>

			<p>How are the results interpreted?</p>

			<p>First, the data are collected in the ﬂow cytometer. Each cell is plotted in a histogram display, which is a frequency distribution. In a typical histogram as shown to the right, two peaks appear.</p>

			<p>The ﬁrst peak represents cells that are negative, and thus have no speciﬁc binding to the probe. The second peak represents cells that are &ldquo;positive&rdquo; for that particular marker, or monoclonal antibody (MAB). Thus, if this were a CD4 MAB, these cells would be considered CD4+ positive (cluster of differentiation positive). From this histogram we can determine the percentage of cells positive for this MAB.</p>

			<p>Using additional monoclonal antibodies it is possible to classify each type of cell (or subset of cells) present in the blood. In the ﬁeld of cytometry, this is called multiple labeling or multi-color ﬂuorescence, as shown below.</p>

			<p>A multipanel display of monoclonal antibodies (MABs) binding to cells. Each histogram identifies a different cluster of cells in the sample. If we integrate the histogram we can determine exactly how many cells are present in each histogram.</p>

			<p>Where do the reagents come from?</p>

			<p>The reagents used to identify CD4 cells and other cells types are called monoclonal antibodies (MABs). These MABs are conjugated (labeled) with fluorescent molecules that can easily be identified using a ﬂow cytometer. These MABs require precise and careful manufacturing protocols. They are quite expensive. In many cases, in addition to the cost of the instrument, the cost of reagents contributes greatly to the overall expense of CD4 determination.</p>

			CD4 Lymphocytes
			CD8 Lymphocytes

			<p>Normal human lymphocytes, T cells are indistinguishable from other lymphocytes using normal visual or size evaluation. To tell the difference, we must add a monoclonal antibody that binds to a specific receptor on either the CD4 or the CD8 cells. We also add a fluorescent molecule to the antibodies and then use flow cytometry to measure the percentage of each type of lymphocyte present.</p>

			<h2>The <em>Cytometry for Life</em> CD4 Counting Device</h2>

			<p>The instrument for the Cytometry for Life program is designed solely to measure CD4 levels in absolute count and percentage of T cells. Cytometer instrument costs and individual test costs are minimized because the machine does not include complex automated ﬂuidics or optics systems. For example, Cytometry for Life has designed an integrated module for the optical and ﬂuidic assembly. The electronics are composed of minimal but very powerful chips. There is no separate computer attached or needed with this technology and therefore it does not require software integration. A USB port has been added to extract data should there be a need to do so. The instrument is low maintenance and does not require highly skilled technicians to operate. The Cytometry for Life CD4 counting instrument is portable and is housed in a small, solid carrying case that includes all necessary reagents and the battery power source. The Cytometry for Life low-cost CD4 testing device is designed to have the capacity to operate in remote, intemperate, and humid regions and not rely on a constant source of electricity.</p>

			<p>Lewis spoke of CD4 machines &ndash; which measure the number of CD4 immune cells and indicate whether someone with AIDS should be treated &ndash; that are bulky, difficult to use and, at about $50,000 each, vastly out of reach for most of the continent. Apoorva Mandavilli, Nature Medicine volume 12: number 10, page 1107 October 2006.</p>

			<p>Cytometry for Life is collaborating with the Regenstrief Center for Health Care Engineering (RCHCE) and the Center for Advanced Manufacturing (CAM) at Purdue University to ensure that the Cytometry for Life low-cost CD4 testing device design can be manufactured in large quantities, at an economical price.</p>

			<p>Significance of CD4 cell counts in HIV/AIDS</p>

			<p>CD4-positive T helper cells are sub-group lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell or leukocyte). A CD4 count is used to monitor immune-system function in HIV-positive individuals. A declining CD4 T-cell count is associated with progression of HIV infection. In HIV-positive patients, AIDS is officially diagnosed when the count drops below 200 cells/&micro;L. Low CD4 counts in HIV-positive individuals (&lt; 200 cells/&micro;L) is a strong indicator that antiretroviral therapy should be administered.</p>

			<p>Antiretroviral Therapy (ART) refers to the treatment of retroviruses, primarily HIV, through usage of certain therapeutic antiretroviral drugs that act at different stages of the virus life cycle.</p>

			<h2><em>Cytometry for Life</em> Program Approach</h2>

			<p>The Cytometry for Life program aims to achieve the following goals in two primary stages:</p>

			<p>Stage 1</p>

			<ol>

				<li>Identify appropriate CD4 device requirements for the African continent.</li>
				<li>Design CD4 measuring devices that are battery operated and computer independent so that they may be easily transported.</li>
				<li>Design a CD4 measuring device that will cost $5,000 USD or less per unit.</li>
				<li>Build these devices to be robust, very easy to use, and yet very high quality.</li>
				<li>Reduce the cost of a single test for CD4 to 0.50 USD or less.</li>

			</ol>

			<p>Stage 2</p>

			<ol>

				<li>Develop a manufacturing model for widespread distribution and management.</li>
				<li>Develop a reagent program that supports the instrumentation and functions in remote areas.</li>
				<li>Partner with manufacturing agents.</li>
				<li>Link with agencies to facilitate distribution to places of need and to provide long-term maintenance programs.</li>

			</ol>

			<p>Lewis continues to speak against what he sees as &ldquo;unconscionable neglect&rdquo; and &ldquo;reckless indifference&rdquo; to AIDS. &ldquo;I think the global community has responded lamentably,&rdquo; he says, his voice rising. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re fighting for human lives, what in God&rsquo;s name is wrong with these people?&rdquo; Apoorva Mandavilli, Nature Medicine, volume 12: number 10, page 1107 October 2006.</p>
