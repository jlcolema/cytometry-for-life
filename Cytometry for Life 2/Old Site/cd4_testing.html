        <h1>CD4 Testing Today</h1>
        <p>Following
the invention of the cell sorter by Mack Fulwyler in 1965, a revolution
occurred within the world of immunology primarily driven by the
innovations of many individuals such as Len Herzenberg. Cytometry has
matured into a powerful technology in medical research and clinical
practice. Recently, Dr. Herzenberg was honored as the <a href="http://www.isac-net.org/" target="_blank">Kyoto Prize</a> winner for his contributions to cytometry. This demonstrates the importance of cytometry in the world of medicine. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>CD4
testing is a normal practice in the clinical laboratory. Flow cytometry
is a standard technique used in virtually every hospital and research
institution around the world. While the techniques are straightforward,
they are not totally simple as we apply them in clinical practice.
There is a need for many controls, and a great deal of automated
technology is employed to accomplish the measurements.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Needless to say, the cost of doing these tests is relatively high. </p>
        <p>&nbsp; </p>
        <p>Today,
however, there are between 30 and 40 million individuals in
resource-poor nations infected with the HIV virus who desperately need
to receive antiviral therapy. There are two primary reasons why they
don't get it. First, the cost is high. Many individuals are working
hard to reduce the cost of this therapy. Second, in order to receive
therapy, each individual must be monitored for his/her CD4 levels. This
is primarily done by flow cytometry. Unfortunately flow cytometry is
complex and expensive in todays technology-focused world.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h1>How a CD4 test is done today?</h1>
        <p>CD4
testing is performed by a flow cytometer. This is a device that is
really quite complex as it is used in modern research laboratories or
in clincal pathology centers. Essentially, you have a small tube of
suspended cells (usually blood) which is treated with a reagent in such
a way that the CD4 cells are labeled to identify themselves. In the
reagent is an antibody which is a molecule that can specifically
attached to a certain type of cell, a CD4 cell. Certain molecules (call
fluorochromes) are attached to the antibody (like the green dots on the
left plot), when we fire a laser beam at the cells, the ones with the
attached molecules send out a signal identifying themseleves. This
signal is called fluorescence and we can easily measure this with some
sensitive detectors. You can also change colors of fluorescence and add
"red" colors to the antibodies so that you can make two measurements at
the same time. If you push hundreds or thousands of cells past the
laser very quickly, you can get a very accurate count of all the cells
that are present. This is how we measure CD4 cells. CD, by the way,
means "cluster of differentiation" and that simply means that this
molecule can be classified into a well defined group of cells. In our
case, it is cluster of differentiation 4 - or a special helper T cell. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h1>How do you interpret the results?</h1>
        <p>First
the data are collected in the flow cytometer and evaluated by plotting
each point in a histogram. Shown below at right is a typical histogram.
You can see that there appears to be two peaks. The first peak is
considered to represent cells that have no specific binding to the
probe in which we are interested. The second peak is what we call
"positive" - thus if these were CD4 cells, they would be called CD4+.</p>
		<img src="cd4_testing_files/histogram1.jpg" align="top" height="142" width="116">
		<p>From
this histogram we obtain numbers for each component. Now we have a
value that we can define how many CD4 cells we have in a sample. While
its a little more complcated than it appears, it's not rocket science.
Now, you can make this really complicated. If you want to prove, beyond
all reasonable doubt that you have only a certain type of cell and no
contaminants, you could add more reagents to classify each type of cell
in the population. In the field of cytometry, we call this multiple
labeling - or multi-color fluorescence as you can see in the
multi-color histograms on the left. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h1>Where do the reagents come from?</h1>
        <p>As
we mentioned earlier, we use what are called monoclonal antibodies
(MABs) that are conjugated (labeled) with fluorescent molecules that we
can easily see with a flow cytometer. These MABs are very special
molecules that have to be manufactured in a very careful way. They are
quite expensive and in many cases, it is the cost of the reagents that
makes a test expensive, althought it is also true that the instruments
are very expensive. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h1>How does the flow cytometer work?   </h1>
        <p>A
laser beam (the blue line) passes through a chamber where a stream of
fluid is flowing. Inside the stream are lots of cells, and some of them
have the different labels on them as described above. When a cell with
a fluorescent molecule on it passes throught the laser beam, photons
are emitted and these are measured on detectors (see the different
colors going out the back of the chamber). Using a scatter signal it is
also possible to determine the morphological charactistics (shape,
size, etc.) of each cell.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; </p>
        <h1>Watch a couple of Introductory lectures on the principles of flow cytometry</h1>
        <p>These
lectures are around 1 hour each. They start at the very fundamentals
and work through to applications. They are primarily designed for
senior-level undergraduates, graduate students, and laboratory
technicians. Although they assume some technical knowledge, the basics
are defined and most people could find them useful regardless of their
technical expertize..</p>
