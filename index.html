			<h1>What is the <em>Cytometry for Life</em> Program?</h1>

			<p>Across Sub-Saharan Africa millions of AIDS (Acquired Immune Deﬁciency Syndrome) victims are desperately in need of antiretroviral treatment. The measurement of the CD4 T-lymphocyte cell levels in the blood of AIDS patients is a critical step that enables AIDS patients to become eligible for therapy. Major gaps exist in the availability of affordable CD4 testing capabilities for the majority of HIV-positive Africans. The <em>Cytometry for Life</em> (C4L) program aims to mitigate this problem by providing low-cost CD4 T cell testing devices for HIV/AIDS patients in areas plagued by the AIDS epidemic that do not have sufﬁcient access to affordable CD4 testing capabilities. Current costs for CD4 testing range from 10 to 12 USD; we propose to decrease this cost to 0.25 to 0.50 USD per test by using innovatively engineered and robust cytometry devices designed to measure only CD4 levels in terms of absolute count and percentage. Such an initiative is critical since approximately 30 million people are infected in Sub-Saharan Africa and almost 320 million Africans exist in extreme poverty, living on less than $1 a day (<a href="http://devdata.worldbank.org/wdi2005/Section1_1_1.htm">http://devdata.worldbank.org/wdi2005/Section1_1_1.htm</a>). Therefore, it is critical that the future of cytometry devices for CD4 measurement in Africa incorporate low-cost options.</p>

			<h2>Why <em>Cytometry for Life</em>?</h2>

			<p>The motivation for Purdue&rsquo;s <em>Cytometry for Life</em> (C4L) program grew out of a call to action by Mr. Stephen Lewis, the UN Secretary General&rsquo;s Special Envoy to HIV/AIDS Relief in Africa, when Mr. Lewis spoke at the 23rd Congress of the International Society for Analytical Cytology (ISAC) in Canada in May, 2006. Mr. Lewis indicated that one major problem (among many) in caring for infected patients in Africa was the lack of low-cost CD4 cell testing technologies.</p>

			<p>Flow cytometers designed for highly industrialized health care environments are the same machines currently being used in developing countries. These instruments are multifaceted and were designed to perform 50 to 100 different tests. In addition to CD4 analysis, such cytometers have the capacity to perform complex multivariate analysis, link to advanced communication systems, and are often fully automated. However, in order to respond to the AIDS crisis across Africa, Cytometry for Life is introducing a new breed of cytometer that only measures CD4 T lymphocyte levels. In the C4L approach, the cytometer device functionality is targeted to one overarching objective: AIDS epidemic mitigation via CD4 monitoring to facilitate antiretroviral treatment procedures. This targeted single-function approach is the primary means by which Cytometry for Life is able to offer such medical innovation with a signiﬁcantly reduced cost while maintaining the highest standards of quality in terms of the CD4 testing procedure and result generation.</p>

			<p>As HIV/AIDS ravages nations in Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Caribbean, it is critical that scientists or supporters of international health and development initiatives contribute to the provision of innovative testing capabilities. Such initiatives must respond speciﬁcally to the need for accurate, low-cost CD4 measurement tools that can operate optimally in remote locations, in a timely fashion.</p>

					<p>We are trying to get quality input into our CD4 project. In order to do this we have created a detailed survey that contains many questions about the CD4 assay and the conditions under which it is needed and carried out. Regardless of who you are or where you are from, we would like your opinion. In order to properly analyze the data however, we will need to know something about you &ndash; your experience level, your knowledge of the field, where you are located, etc. You can answer general questions without identifying yourself, but we would like to have your complete contact information if possible so that we can continue to work with you on this project.</p>
