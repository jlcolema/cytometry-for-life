			<h1>The Importance of Cytometry for HIV/AIDS in Africa</h1>

			<p>In Sub-Saharan Africa, there is a great need for antiretroviral therapy. Deﬁciencies in CD4 testing capacity remain a major barrier for the administration of antiretroviral therapy. The guidelines for antiretroviral therapy (ART) from the World Health Organization mandate therapeutic intervention for patients with Stage I or II HIV disease with CD4 cell counts less than 200/&micro;l in Sub-Saharan Africa. This CD4 T-lymphocyte assessment is done by ﬂow cytometry. Unfortunately, ﬂow cytometry is a complex and expensive method in today&rsquo;s high technology–focused world.</p>

			<p>This problem can be solved. Cytometers can be made very inexpensively. With a 40-year history of technological development, cytometry has matured to a point that it can now be simpliﬁed for speciﬁc purposes, such as measurement of CD4 cells. While next-generation ideas are very important and have increased commercial opportunity for westernized healthcare networks, they are not the best solution for the immediate problem of evaluating AIDS patients in Africa today. The complexity of cytometers currently in use drives up the cost for the consumer, limits the number of instruments that can be purchased, and also increases the need for high-cost maintenance and highly skilled operators. Introduction of low-cost, robust, and portable machines through the Cytometry for Life program seeks to close gaps in CD4 testing coverage, particularly in rural African settings which demand innovative solutions in order to best service this target population.</p>

			<h2>Rural vs Urban: What are the challenges of implenting CD4 testing capabilities in rural Africa?</h2>

			<p>UNAIDS estimates that over half the approximately 30 million people living with HIV/AIDS in Sub-Saharan Africa reside in rural areas. Poverty in Africa is particularly onerous in rural areas. More than 70% of the continent&rsquo;s poor people live in rural challenges of implementing CD4 areas. The Cytometry for Life program responds to a testing capabilities in rural Africa? fundamental and urgent need for the introduction of low-cost, robust, and portable CD4 testing devices. UNAIDS estimates that over half the approximately This is especially critical in rural areas where CD4 30 million people living with HIV/AIDS in Sub-testing capacity must still contend with exorbitant Saharan Africa reside in rural areas. Poverty in Africa costs, inaccessibility, and a lack of trained personnel to operate and maintain equipment. While some current cytometry instruments are suitable for urban areas with sufficient infrastructure, rural/remote areas with moderate to poor infrastructure are still urgently in need of affordable, environment-appropriate CD4 testing solutions.</p>

					<h3>Survey on CD4</h3>
					<p>We are trying to get quality input into our CD4 project. In order to do this we have created a detailed survey that contains many questions about the CD4 assay and the conditions under which it is needed and carried out. Regardless of who you are or where you are from, we would like your opinion. In order to properly analyze the data however, we will need to know something about you &ndash; your experience level, your knowledge of the field, where you are located, etc. You can answer general questions without identifying yourself, but we would like to have your complete contact information if possible so that we can continue to work with you on this project.</p>

					<p><a href="#">The survey can be found on the sponsor page of this website.</a></p>
